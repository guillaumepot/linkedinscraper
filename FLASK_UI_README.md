- `preferences.yaml` - Application preferences

### Dependencies
The CV matching feature requires:
- `scikit-learn` - For TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity
- `PyPDF2` - For PDF text extraction
- Elasticsearch with indexed job descriptions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Jobs not loading**
- Check Elasticsearch is running on localhost:9200
- Verify the 'jobs' index exists and contains data
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**Search not working**
- Ensure job descriptions are indexed in Elasticsearch
- Check that the multi_match query fields exist

**Status updates failing**
- Verify job IDs are correctly formatted
- Check Flask application logs for errors
- Ensure Elasticsearch write permissions

**CV upload failing**
- Ensure `/app` directory has write permissions
- Check file size limits (default Flask limit is 16MB)
- Verify only PDF files are being uploaded
- Check Flask application logs for detailed errors

**CV matching not working**
- Ensure scikit-learn is installed (`pip install scikit-learn`)
- Check that job descriptions contain text content
- Verify CV file was uploaded successfully to `/app/cv.pdf`
- Check console for CV processing errors

**CV match percentages showing 0%**
- Verify CV file contains readable text (not just images)
- Check that job descriptions are properly indexed
- Ensure CV and job descriptions are in the same language
- Try uploading a different CV format or content

**Styling issues**
- Clear browser cache
- Check that Bootstrap CSS is loading
- Verify static files are being served correctly
